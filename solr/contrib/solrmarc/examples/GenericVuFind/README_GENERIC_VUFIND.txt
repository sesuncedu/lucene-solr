The GenericVuFind example is the code used to index MaRC data for 
VuFind (http://vufind.org).

This example can be used as a springboard for sites using VuFind.

See  http://code.google.com/p/solrmarc/wiki/VuFindHowTo

More complex indexing for VuFind can be seen in the stanfordVuFind example.
   
The VuFind project URL is http://vufind.org/


Note that the convention in VuFind is to name what solrmarc refers to as the config.properties file as import.properties
and what solrmarc refers to as index.properties files as marc.properties and marc_local.properties
