The GenericBlacklight example is the code used to index MaRC data for the 
Blacklight (http://projectblacklight.org) demo application.

This example can be used as a springboard for sites using Blacklight on top of a
Solr index created from MaRC data.

See  http://code.google.com/p/solrmarc/wiki/BlacklightHowTo

More complex indexing for Blacklight can be seen in the stanfordBlacklight and 
UvaBlacklight examples.

The Blacklight project URL is http://projectblacklight.org/
