The stanfordBlacklight example is the code used to index MaRC data for 
Stanford's Blacklight implementation, which can be seen at

  http://searchworks.stanford.edu

This example is provided as an exemplar containing MaRC --> Blacklight Solr 
index mappings reflecting data complexities encountered in a large research
library, as well as accommodating the indexing needs for Stanford's locally 
customized Blacklight implementation.
