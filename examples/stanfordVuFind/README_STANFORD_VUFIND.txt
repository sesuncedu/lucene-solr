The stanfordVuFind example is the code used to index MaRC data for Stanford's 
VuFind implementation. Stanford has switched to using Blacklight, so there is
no extant version of VuFind demonstrating the use of a Solr index created with
this code.

This example is provided as an exemplar containing MaRC --> VuFind Solr index
mappings reflecting data complexities encountered in a large research library.
